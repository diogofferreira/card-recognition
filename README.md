# Playing Card Recognition

This project was proposed in the context of Visual Computing subject and its main purpose was to apply multiple techniques of lower level image processing, using the OpenCV library. A real-time card recognition software was developed, and it might be useful integrating it in other platforms (casinos, card games AI agents, etc.). 

In order to run the app, you just need to have g++ and cmake, aswell as OpenCV
libraries.

```
cmake .
make
```

```
./card_recognition
```
